    Parse and prepare transport demand profiles.

    This function processes regional transport demand data and calculates
    normalized demand profiles (shapes) for use in EV demand modeling.

    Args:
        transport_demand_path (str): Path to the CSV file containing regional 
                                   transport demand data with buses as columns 
                                   and time periods as index.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: Normalized transport demand profiles with the same structure 
                     as input but with values representing demand shares/proportions.
                     Each column (region) sums to 1.0 across all time periods.

    Processing steps:
        1. Load regional transport demand data from CSV file
        2. Calculate normalized demand profiles by dividing each region's demand 
           by its total annual demand
        3. Return demand shape profiles for use in EV demand modeling
